    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables based on the relationship between the categories and the target variable. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with high cardinality categorical variables, i.e., variables with a large number of unique categories.\n",

For example, if we are studying the relationship between a person's age and their income, we can use covariance to determine whether there is a positive or negative relationship between these two variables. If there is a positive covariance, it means that as a person's age increases, their income also tends to increase. If there is a negative covariance, it means that as a person's age increases, their income tends to decrease.\n",

    "For the categorical variables in the dataset, we can use different encoding methods based on the nature of the variable and the machine learning algorithm we plan to use. Here are some common encoding methods for each variable:\n",

    "Gender (Binary Categorical Variable): Since Gender has only two categories (Male/Female), we can use binary encoding to convert it into a numerical variable. We can assign 0 to Male and 1 to Female.\n",
    "Education Level (Nominal Categorical Variable): Since Education Level has more than two categories and there is no inherent order or hierarchy among them, we can use one-hot encoding to convert it into a numerical variable. One-hot encoding creates a new binary variable for each category, where the value is 1 if the category is present and 0 otherwise. For example, we can create four new variables: High School, Bachelor's, Master's, and PhD. If a person has a High School education level, then the value of the High School variable will be 1 and all other variables will be 0.\n",
    "Employment Status (Ordinal Categorical Variable): Since Employment Status has three categories with an inherent order or hierarchy (Unemployed < Part-Time < Full-Time), we can use ordinal encoding to convert it into a numerical variable. Ordinal encoding assigns a unique numerical value to each category based on its rank or position in the hierarchy. For example, we can assign 1 to Unemployed, 2 to Part-Time, and 3 to Full-Time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of encoding method depends on the nature of the variable and the machine learning algorithm we plan to use.

A positive covariance indicates that the two variables tend to vary together, while a negative covariance indicates that they tend to vary in opposite directions. The magnitude of the covariance indicates how strong the relationship is, with larger magnitudes indicating stronger relationships. However, the magnitude alone does not tell us anything about the strength of the relationship relative to the scales of the variables. Therefore, we often use correlation coefficients instead of covariances to measure the strength of linear relationships between variables."
